<b>FTUNet: A Semantic Segmentation Model for Medical Image Lesion Region Based on U-shaped Network and Transformer</b>

Semantic segmentation is used in a large number of fields, especially in medical image processing.  On the other hand, the Transformer has been introduced into the field of Computer Vision. A large number of experiments show that the combination of U-type codec and Transformer can better handle this problem. Specifically, this paper proposes a deep network FTUNet. The model code has been uploaded, and researchers and scholars are welcome to consult.


## Environment
he program runs on a high-performance server, with Pytorch version no less than 1.13.0 and Python version 3.8.15.
